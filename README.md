Hello, 

My name is Vajk, I'm a frontend developer passionate about building user-friendly and visually stunning web experiences. 
Daily, I wield the power of Angular and TypeScript, crafting captivating UIs with the help of Tailwind. 
However, React and Next.js are also in my arsenal, ready to be deployed when the project demands.

Always eager to experiment with the latest technologies, I thrive on creating awesome things. 
I believe web development shouldn't just be functional, it should be beautiful too.

Here is my portfolio website (2 years old, i will create a new one in the neer future):

Have fun with coding!
